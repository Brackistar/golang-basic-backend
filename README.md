# Warning!
After starting the development of the mongoDB component, the course's coupled design becomes so incompatible with my moddifications, I currently have not the time, nor the willpower to redesign this project in any way to make it better, so onwards expect a lot of coupling and bad practices... I'm sorry for what you are going to see going forward, but getting to the end takes priority here.
